# home-made-punto-switcher for ubuntu
Simple as wood

Dependencies
 - node.js
 - xclip
 - xdotool

How to use
  Assign hot-key:
    Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Custom shortcuts -> New (command: node {path}/punto.js)
    
  select string (by mouse or ctrl+a) and press selected hot-key.
  

Notes:
  - Would be great to rewrite on bash to exclude node.js dependency.
  - In skype works only if select text using mouse
